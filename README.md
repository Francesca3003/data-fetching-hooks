/* Data Fetching with fetch and UseEffect -2 */
    
Starting from the previous exercise, create a new GithubUsers component that has a form with a text input and a submit button.
The input will be used for searching a user by providing their username.
Each user will be displayed in a list, where each list item is a GithubUser component.
These components will take username as a prop.

/* Custom Hooks -3 */
Extract the logic to fetch a Github user's data from the GithubUser component from the third exercise of Context into a custom hook called useGithubUser.
